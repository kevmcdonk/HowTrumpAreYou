# How Trump Are You?

This repo contains all the code for the app that was created at the European SharePoint Conference 2017 by Martin Veen, Carlo van der Zon, Kurt Van Hamme and Kevin McDonnell.

If you would like some more detail on how the app was built, you can watch the European SharePoint Community Webcast at https://vimeo.com/205209188.

To set up the application, you will need to configure a Blob Storage account, an Azure WebAPI and create a Custom API for PowerApps.

Once you have all these, the web.config will need to be updated with the relevant keys and accounts.

This was a hacked application created over 24 hours. It is simple, hacked and may need a little nudging to get working which we can only apologise for! Please log any issues you find.
